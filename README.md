This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## ZAION SHOP

You are more than welcome

### What is Zion Shop ?

Zion, is a fictional and themed eccommerce, where you can find everything you need for your the day to day life.
This repository offers you a unique visual experience, mixing technology and history, combining the power of online shopping
and mysterious Egypt, where each subcategory is represented by a different Egyptian god and organized according to their respective characteristics.

### Why do we use Egypt as a theme?

Simple, Egypt was used as a base, since from the beginning, it revolutionized the way we see the world today. Thanks to Egypt, we learned construction, writing, agriculture techniques, we understood how its religion was formed and most important of all, Egypt left us the legacy of the economy, the market, exchanges, money and purchasing power.

In this fictional eccommerce, the power of history over the millennia, the legacy of a people, technology and a new world, with new horizons, came together.
Thus generating a thematic and totally original eccommerce, where the past and the future meet.
